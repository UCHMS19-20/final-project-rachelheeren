# Surviving Magnet

As many of us are aware, Magnet can be really challenging. So to find some fun in that, I created a game of the ✧･ﾟ:*✧･ﾟ:****Magnet experience****:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧.

In this game, the goal is to finish all four years of high school while maintaining the highest possible grade. If you get below a 65 at any point, you drop out of Magnet and lose.

To get through the pits of doom aka high school, you must go through an entire A and B day schedule. During each class, you will either have the option to choose what you do or get a free period. Some choices will be beneficial to you, other won't be. If you can survive the grueling trials of Sanservino's class or ace Mrs. Kipp's Kahoots, this is the game for you. Good luck on your endeavors!
